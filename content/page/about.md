Hi, I'm [Cooper Pan (潘正明)](http://localhost:1313/page/about/), a Quality Testing Engineer who learn some program language, but not professional. Also, I'm very interested in [cloud computing](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E4%BA%91%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97/9969353?fr=aladdin) like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). This blog will record the progress of learning, as for why learning kubernetes, in order to build a Agile testing system with a lot of [Continuous integration and Continuous delivery](https://landscape.cncf.io/) tools in the kubernetes's community. Please let me know, if something wrong or some suggestions, it will help me a lot, thank you!
